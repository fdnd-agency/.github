# Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
_A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]_

When I make an issue with this template, I see no structure cause of the placed text. I always change its template to make it more structured for myself

# Describe the solution you'd like
_A clear and concise description of what you want to happen._

I always use the template below. This one has a clear heading, and after you made the issue, it's clear which input is given. 

* The text has an heading now, makes it more clear. I don't know why this hasn't been used in the first place?
* I also made the description below the heading a quote. But maybe it has to be italic. But it makes it more clear which content has been written by the author, and which content is from the template.

maybe it's more clear if the description below the heading is in _italic_
